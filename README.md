# <h1 align="center">ðŸ“” Arkitecc's Stable Diffusion WebUI Bash Suite ðŸ“”</h1>

### I've added a complete walkthrough for how to set all of this up to my main installation guide over at ðŸ“”[Stable Diffusion Local Install Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1owAMJGe56sbocCdrv7IO8fM6I4NLqxZ2bJgfI7EsYAw/edit#heading=h.lol8qgvyhlg2)ðŸ“”!

#### Hi hi everyone! I'm back at it again, this time with a sick set of bash scripts for managing two of the most popular / awesome repos of Stable Diffusion, HLKY's [SD-WebUI](https://github.com/sd-webui/stable-diffusion-webui) and AUTOMATIC1111's [SD-WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)! 

#### I created this suite of bash scripts to assist people in getting SD-WebUI installed on the Runpod cloud with a single web terminal command, and additional scripts to assist with easy management of SD-WebUI post-installation.

#### If you'd like to support me and my work, please consider dropping by my [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/arkitecc) or signing up for Runpod using this link: [Arki's Easy SD-WebUI](https://runpod.io/gsc?template=2zlpsxev91&ref=borq1onw)  it includes my template which will automatically have these scripts included on your Linux pod on boot.

#### As far as I'm aware, my installation of HLKY's SD-WebUI is the most comprehensive edition available right now, as I include the commonly left out Latent Diffusion Super Resolution upscaler that HLKY's SD-WebUI supports. 

#### IMPORTANT: Each script will require you to enter 'chmod +x scriptname.sh && bash scriptname.sh' (without apostrophes) into the web console the first time that you use them. CTRL + SHIFT + V is how you paste into the web console. 

#### This gives Linux the proper permission to run my scripts before executing the scripts for the first time. Afterward, you can run them simply with 'bash scriptname.sh'.

#### If you need to get into the desktop environment to set up cloud storage for your images, or to debug anything, go into your Connect settings on Runpod _(all pods except A100 due to lack of display support)_ and plug in the IP address, a colon, and then the external port number into your browser. 

#### When prompted use the S/N "user" with Password "stablediff" (unless you've changed it in the template settings).

#### I recommend backing up the whole /stable-diffusion-webui/outputs/ folder to be sure you have all of your art. Dragging and dropping this folder into a cloud storage provider to update it after each session is recommended. Guide on how to set up Google Drive automatic art backups can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wXrFKPq5wi4fK7y7Ww7ALf2yj1cVmJLbROO0b_u6y9A/edit)


## Scripts Included: 

## ðŸ“” ArkiSD-I.sh & ArkiSDA-I.sh

#### The big boi. With a single line entered into the web console this bad boi will do literally everything for you, including giving you a link at the end that will allow you to use either SD-WebUI's frontend from your local pc. 

#### Keep the tab with this web terminal open while you're using or running your pod for the first time. Duplicate the tab if you'd like to run the other scripts as I've detailed them below.

#### Initialize it with 'chmod +x ArkiSD-I.sh && bash ArkiSD-I.sh' or 'chmod +x ArkiSDA-I.sh && bash ArkiSDA-I.sh'. 

#### It'll ask you for a direct link to your model file, I recommend using Dropbox for this. 

#### Link Format: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/fileidhere/model.ckpt Replace 'fileidhere' with the string of letters and numbers Dropbox gives you with your shared link to your model.ckpt file.  

## ðŸ“” ArkiSD-IT.sh

#### Run this script after the initial install script if you're planning to use Textual Inversion embeddings with HLKY's SD-WebUI that you've trained elsewhere. 
#### Initialize it with 'chmod +x ArkiSD-IT.sh && bash ArkiSD-IT.sh'.

## ðŸ“” ArkiSD-R.sh & ArkiSDA-R.sh

#### After installing and running for the first time, you won't need to run the install script again. Instead, run this script to get started the next time you need to start up SD-WebUI. If your interface ever stops working for you, press CTRL-C inside of the console and initialize this script again. 

#### Initialize it with 'chmod +x ArkiSD-R.sh && bash ArkiSD-R.sh' or 'chmod +x ArkiSDA-R.sh && bash ArkiSDA-R.sh'.

## ðŸ“” ArkiSD-RT.sh & ArkiSDA-RT.sh 

#### If you've installed support for Textual Inversion embeddings, you'll want to run this script whenever you need to start up SD-WebUI. 

#### For AUTOMATIC1111's SD-WebUI this will launch SD with the Textual Inversion support enabled. 

#### Initialize it with 'chmod +x ArkiSD-RT.sh && bash ArkiSD-RT.sh' or 'chmod +x ArkiSDA-RT.sh && bash ArkiSDA-RT.sh'.

## ðŸ“” ArkiSD-U.sh & ArkiSDA-U.sh

#### If you'd like to stay up to date, run this script to pull the latest changes. Pass the -t argument with your run command in order to update an installation of HLKY's SD-WebUI that has Textual Inversion support.

#### Initialize it with 'chmod +x ArkiSD-U.sh && bash ArkiSD-U.sh' or 'chmod +x ArkiSDA-U.sh && bash ArkiSDA-U.sh'.
